# MCPhotonics3D
Monte Carlo simulation of photons propagation

Simulation code for raytracing in pure geometrical approximation with some features like absorbtion, photoluminescence and others.
Written in Matlab, supports multy-threading, but not optimized. 
Supports 3D geometry of the simulation area

For now looks a bit messy, but I will fix it soon
